<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Gustavo, a 30-year-old with a passion for growth and continuous learning. With a solid business college degree under my belt, I've spent the last 9 years working in a renowned bank in Brazil, where I've gained valuable experience in the financial world.</p>
 <p>Despite my successful career in banking, I've always had a fascination for the digital realm. I'm drawn to the dynamic nature of technology and the endless opportunities it offers. My easygoing nature and openness to new experiences have led me to the realization that it's time for a change. I'm excited to embark on a new journey, one that aligns with my interests and aspirations.</p>
  <p>Web development has captured my imagination, and I see it as a perfect fit for my fast-learning abilities. I'm eager to dive headfirst into coding and design, crafting websites and applications that have a real impact on people's lives. Transitioning from finance to tech may seem like a leap, but I believe my adaptability and determination will guide me through this transformation.</p>
  <p>During my time in the banking world, I've developed essential skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork. These abilities, combined with my business acumen, will undoubtedly complement my path as a web developer.</p>
  <p>When I'm not immersed in my career pursuits, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, taking long walks, or catching up with friends over a cup of coffee. I'm a firm believer in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and I'm always up for trying new hobbies or activities.</p>
  <p>I am thrilled about the prospect of embracing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the world of web development. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals, learn from experienced mentors, and contribute to meaningful projects that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.</p>
