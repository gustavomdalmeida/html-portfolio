<h1>The Best Movies According to Gustavo</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Films Of All Times</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dancing In The Dark</h3>
<p>This movie is really shocking and very sad, but it's really good, and have a great performance of Bjork.</p>
<h3>Everything Everywhere Everytime</h3>
<p>The movie starts with a super tec vibe, because of the multiverse theme, but it's more than that, is a deep movie about relation ships, in a romantic way and in an family way.</p>
<h3>Wall-E</h3>
<p>This movie was my favorite for a long time, it's a cartoon movie but there's a social criticism.</p>
